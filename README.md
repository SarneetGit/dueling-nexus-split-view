# Dueling Nexus Split View

This is the repository for https://userstyles.org/styles/144946/duelingnexus-chat-monster-info-split-view that can be used with the Stylish addon in most browsers. Its primary aim is to make the left side of the screen more usable, making the chat and monster info boxes not overlap but scroll, and makes the monster info picture slightly scrollable as well to retain more vertical space for card text - this makes it easier to read cards by just hovering your mouse over them rather than having to also scroll the card text to finish reading. 

The style seen on the above link at userstyles.org is licensed under the GPL3. This project may also contain additional styles that go further with customisation and adjust visuals, possibly enlarging things to make the game better suited to high dpi / large screens or changing colours around. These styles are the works of their respective authors and held here for convenience.
