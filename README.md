# Dueling Nexus Split View

This is the repository for a collection of css stylesheets to tweak duelingnexus.com.
It started out as a tweak for the chat overflowing onto the left side of the screen, and now is becoming multiple styles available at userstyles.org or to copy from for use in other css injection browser add ons.

This minimalist style tries to save as much vertical screen space as possible, makes the chat, card image and card container box fixed heights and scrollable, with the card info box then able to take up the majority of the vertical space.

Stripped down style of the first that just makes the chat and card box scroll

This more encompassing style is aimed at larger screens and *restyles* duelingnexus in most areas to improve the visuals, it also fixes the chat and code between the two projects is sometimes shared.
